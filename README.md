# React Contact Form

## What is it?

A fully-featured contact form built with React, Formik, Yup and Treact that is stylish, has validation and can actually send emails.

## Why use it?

If you've ever wanted to quickly slap together a contact form then this is for you. It's not built to be complex, its built to work.

## How does it work?

- [x] [Formik](https://formik.org/) - Handles all the form field binding and state tracking.
- [x] [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) - Handles all the validation.
- [x] [Treact](https://treact.owaiskhan.me/) - Handles the component and styling. This library is made using React and TailWind Css.
- [x] [Emails]() - Handled by a Netlify function that integrates with [SendInBlue](https://www.sendinblue.com/). You can find the function app [here](), either use this one or swop in your own email mechanism.

I've written a [blog post]() that explains more about this contact form and why I built it.
